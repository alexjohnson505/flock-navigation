This project is inspired by [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/index.html)' research in modeling flocking behaviour. Reynolds was influenced by the animal motions of flocks such as birds, or fish schools. Reynolds referred to his generic [simulated flocking creatures as Boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).
