=====================

A graphics experiment using flock behavior and simple AI to provide basic interaction and 'visual delight' to the user.

** Themes: 
 - provide "visual delight".
 - take user interaction

** Goals

The player builds a swarm of fish. The swarm tracks
down randomly generated food. Eating food provides exp
points, allowing players to 'level up' their swarm in one
of three different ways:
 - More fish
 - More swarms
 - Faster
 - Larger Fish

** Special Thanks:

Inspiration and code from ss5_7_flock, and in class
example program, implementing Craig Reynold's classic 
autonomous steering behaviors, see http://www.red3d.com/cwr
