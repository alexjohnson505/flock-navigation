swarm-navigation
=====================

Using Processing.js to expiriment with flock behavior. This project aims to provide basic 'visual' delight to the user, while demonstrating semi-random flocking AI behaviour.

User Interaction:
-------------

Swarms navigate the environment. When a fish
collects a food, they reproduce, and their health
is refreshed. When a fish goes too long without
eating, they will fade away and die (yellow ripple).

Click on the screen to place a new food item
at the center of your cursor.

Press 'W' & 'S' to change the currently selected
swarm. Notice how a white box is drawn around their
color in the top left of the screen.

Press 'D' to grant extra fish to the currently
selected swarm.

Running:
-------------

Serve index.html from an Apache server.
