      <h1>Swarm Navigation</h1>

      <p>An experiment in emulating Swarm Behaviour. Special thanks to Craig Reynold's research in <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr">autonomous steering behaviors</a>,  and Daniel Shiffman's research and code implementation from his book <a href="http://natureofcode.com">The Nature of Code</a>.</p>

      <p>Swarms navigate the environment. When a fish collects a food, they reproduce, and their health is refreshed. When a fish goes too long without eating, they will fade away and die.</p>

      <p>Hold <b>'LEFT' &amp; 'RIGHT'</b> to control the Player Fish's direction. </p>

      <p>Hold <b>'UP' &amp; 'DOWN'</b> to make slight adjustments to acceleration.</p>

      <p>The Player Fish is a single, blue fish with a white outline. The other blue fish are your swarm. They will attempt to flock with you if you are close by.</p>
